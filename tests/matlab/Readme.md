# Tests
If you followed the steps from the main readme for installation, you should be able to just run the script.

Otherwise, you need to set [Pulseq-CEST](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest) in your MATLAB path and the *bmcppfit* executeable in your PATH (system, not MATLAB) manually.

The test script will simulate a Z-spectrum with the original settings, with the initial parameters before the fit and the fitted parameters.
