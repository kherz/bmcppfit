# Tests
To run the MATLAB Tests, you need to have [Pulseq-CEST](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest) in your MATLAB path and the *bmcppfit* executeable in your PATH (system, not MATLAB).


The test script will simulate a Z-spectrum with the original settings, with the initial parameters before the fit and the fitted parameters.
